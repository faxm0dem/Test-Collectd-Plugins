Revision history for Test-Collectd-Plugins

0.1005  Thu Sep 20 13:09:37 CEST 2012
        - slight change to add absolute path to "yapp" in Makefile postamble
          as suggested by BinGOs on #cpantesters-discuss

0.1004  Thu Sep 20 09:21:51 CEST 2012
        - bumped Parse::Yapp requirement to version 0.22 (yapp.pl renamed to yapp)
          this presumably caused UNKNOWN test state in some build systems on cpantesters
0.1003  Fri Aug 24 15:14:08 CEST 2012
        - fix bug where import args were not passed through thus making 'tests => N' work
        - make comments more polite

0.1001  May 16 12:04:01 CEST 2012
        Release
