Test-Collectd-Plugins

This module aids in Collectd perl plugin development.
As of the time of writing, there was no proper way to test Collectd perl plugins
outside of collectd's perl interpreter. The best option was to run the plugin using
collectd, then any of EnableDebugger option, csv plugin, logfile plugin, running collectd
in foreground etc.
Using this module, you can test your fresh new collectd plugin as easily as 'read_ok("Collectd::Plugins::NewFresh","newfresh")'.
